## The task is to make a Pokémon search page using the PokéAPI.

1. Create a form with a search input and submit button
2. When the form is submitted request the Pokémon the user typed from "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/NAME"
3. If the request succeeds show the Pokémon’s name and sprite
4. If the request fails show a relevant error to the user


### Stretch goals 
If you have extra time try using some of the other data in the response body to show e.g. the pokémon’s types or stats. Write some CSS to make it pretty!
